<h2>My Personal Process/Experience:</h2>
The Security Plus Exam covers various cybersecurity processes, methodologies, and terminology. As such, I found studying easy as I enjoyed absorbing all the new information. The background that I already possessed helped a lot when trying to digest new concepts. I started my initial process with a video series offered by Professor Messer on YouTube. This series is split into one hundred and twenty-one videos and has over fifteen hours of content. It was beneficial since it covered every bullet point from the exam objectives while using real-world examples and diagrams to explain the concepts. To make things easier, I would watch ten videos daily for twelve days. I spent around an hour and a half each day learning new material. However, I was worried that only watching the videos during these first twelve days wouldn't be enough to understand the concepts initially. I used ChatGPT to ask me three questions for each concept I covered that day. While it would be nothing like a question on the exam, it would help me ensure I had a basic understanding of the concept. Here is the prompt that I used:
<br />
<br />
<br /><b>
"Hello, I am currently studying for my SYN-701 Exam (Security Plus) offered by CompTIA. Please help tutor me by asking three questions for each exam objective. Try your best to word questions like they'd appear on the exam. Ask each multiple-choice question one at a time and prompt me for an answer. Once I answer, explain the correct answer and also explain why the incorrect answers are wrong in the context of the question. Also, before asking the questions, please list the ten objectives so that I know that you understand them. These are the objectives I studied today:"
<br />
<br />
(Enter the ten video titles here)
<br />
<br />
"For a better explanation of what each of these topics covers, here is the full objective list from the official pdf of the ten objectives mentioned above. Make sure to keep all of this in mind when forming questions about each of the ten topics:"
<br />
<br />
(Copy and paste all of the contents from the exam pdf that were covered that day)
<br />
<br />
<br /></b>
Now that I had a rough idea of everything the exam would cover, it was time to test my new knowledge. I used various resources to accomplish this, primarily the practice exams Jason Dion and Professor Messer offered. Over two weeks, I took eight practice exams (six of which I took twice) and reviewed every question extensively. These resources are great because they explain the reasoning behind each answer. I occasionally rewatched and reviewed Professor Messer's videos if I didn't understand the explanation. However, most of the time, I utilized a method that I found more efficient with ChatGPT. I saw a video from a content creator named Ben Truong, who used it to summarize any topic and explain its relevance when he studied for his exam. I decided to do something similar, so I used his prompt for any topic I missed on the practice exams that I still did not understand after reading the explanation. Here is that prompt:
<br />
<br /><b>
"I am currently studying to get my CompTIA Security+. I want you to act as if you are my tutor preparing me for the test. I will ask you about many different concepts, and I want your answers to include a few things." 
<br />
<br />
1. General overview of the concept 
<br />
<br />
2. What I might need to know about it for the Security+ exam
<br />
<br /></b>
After a month of learning, studying, and reviewing, I finally felt confident to take the exam. I reviewed different Performance-based Questions (PBQs) and Professor Messer's note sheet the night before to calm my nerves. The test itself went very smoothly, and I scored 775/900 in the end. CompTIA also provided me with a score report, which I could use to review the concepts that I did not do well on. Overall, it was an excellent experience, and I am glad I pushed myself to learn the new material.
