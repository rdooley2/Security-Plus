<h2>My Personal Process/Experience:</h2>
The Security Plus Exam covers a variety of different cybersecurity processes, methodologies, and terminology. As such, I found it pretty easy to study as I enjoyed getting to absorb all of the new information. The background that I already possessed helped a lot when trying to digest new concepts. I started my initial process with a video series offered by Professor Messer on YouTube. This series is split into 121 videos and has over 15 hours of content. It was very useful since it covered every single bullet point from the exam objectives while also using real-world examples and diagrams to explain the concepts. To make things easier for myself, I would watch 10 videos a day for 12 days total. This meant I was spending around an hour and a half each day learning new material. However, I was worried that only watching the videos during these first 12 days wouldn't be enough to initially understand the concepts. As such, I decided to use ChatGPT to ask me three questions for each concept that I covered that day. While it would be nothing like a question on the real exam, it would at the very least help me ensure that I had a basic understanding of the concept. This ended up working well and the AI rarely encountered any problems. Here is the prompt that I used:

Hello, I am currently studying for my SYN-701 Exam (Security Plus) offered by CompTIA. Please help tutor me by asking three questions for each exam objective. Try your best to word questions like they'd appear on the exam. Ask each multiple-choice question one at a time and prompt me for an answer. Once I answer, explain the correct answer and also explain why the incorrect answers are wrong in the context of the question. Also, before asking the questions, please list the ten objectives so that I know that you understand them. These are the objectives I studied today:

For a better explanation of what each of these topics covers, here is the full objective list from the official pdf of the ten objectives mentioned above. Make sure to keep all of this in mind when forming questions about each of the ten topics:

Now that I had a rough idea of everything that would be covered on the exam, it was time to polish up. This is when I used practice exams to test my knowledge and iron out any kinks.
