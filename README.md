<h2>My Personal Process/Experience:</h2>
The Security Plus Exam covers a variety of different cybersecurity processes, methodologies, and terminology. As such, I found it pretty easy to study as I enjoyed getting to absorb all of the new information. The background that I already possessed helped a lot when trying to digest new concepts. I started my initial process with a video series offered by Professor Messer on YouTube. This series is split into 121 videos and has over 15 hours of content. It was very useful since it covered every single bullet point from the exam objectives while also using real-world examples and diagrams to explain the concepts. To make things easier for myself, I would watch 10 videos a day for 12 days total. This meant I was spending around an hour and a half each day learning new material. However, I was worried that only watching the videos during these first 12 days wouldn't be enough to initially understand the concepts. As such, I decided to use ChatGPT to ask me three questions for each concept that I covered that day. While it would be nothing like a question on the real exam, it would at the very least help me ensure that I had a basic understanding of the concept. This ended up working well and the AI rarely encountered any problems. Here is the prompt that I used:

Hello, I am currently studying for my SYN-701 Exam (Security Plus) offered by CompTIA. Please help tutor me by asking three questions for each exam objective. Try your best to word questions like they'd appear on the exam. Ask each multiple-choice question one at a time and prompt me for an answer. Once I answer, explain the correct answer and also explain why the incorrect answers are wrong in the context of the question. Also, before asking the questions, please list the ten objectives so that I know that you understand them. These are the objectives I studied today:

For a better explanation of what each of these topics covers, here is the full objective list from the official pdf of the ten objectives mentioned above. Make sure to keep all of this in mind when forming questions about each of the ten topics:

Now that I had a rough idea of everything that would be covered on the exam, it was time to test my new knowledge. I used a variety of different resources to accomplish this, primarily the practice exams offered by Jason Dion and Professor Messer. For over a week and a half I went over 9 practice exams and reviewed every single question extensively. Both of these resources are great because they provide reasoning for why each answer is right and why the other options are not. In the chance that I still did not understand the explanation, I would occasionally review Professor Messer's Videos and review. However, most of the time I utilized a method that I found to be more efficient with ChatGPT. I saw a video from a content creator named Ben Truong using it to summarize any topic and explain its relevance when he studied for the exam. I thought I would do something similar so used his prompt for any topic I missed on the practice exams that I still did not understand after reading the explanation. Here is that prompt:

I am currently studying to get my CompTIA Security+. I want you to act as if you are my tutor preparing me for the test. I will ask you about many different concepts, and I want your answers to include a few things. 
<br />
<br />
1. General overview of the concept 
<br />
<br />
2. What I might need to know about it for the Security+ exam 
<br />
<br />

After a month of learning, studying, and reviewing, I finally felt confident enough to take the exam.
